          <h2>Anime</h2>
          <p>
            Anime (Japanese: アニメ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated
            animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English,
            anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However,
            in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of
            the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless
            of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to
            Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games
            sometimes also feature themes and artstyles that can be considered
            as "anime". The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to
            1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works
            of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades,
            developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed
            theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media,
            and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are
            often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video
            games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad
            and niche audiences. Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive
            production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
            technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization,
            cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic
            techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production
            generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of
            settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and
            angle shots.[3] Diverse art styles are used, and character
            proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common
            characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.
